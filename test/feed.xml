    <title>It's easy to mine sensitive data from call records, study shows</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Even the least invasive surveillance tools can provide a detailed look at a person’s life, according to a new study &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1508081113"&gt;published today in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study looks at telephone metadata, which shows who a person called and when. Most courts treat that information as less sensitive than the contents of a call or email, and investigators can often obtain it without a warrant. But today’s study shows how investigators can use that information to infer where a person lives, who their friends are, and even specific hobbies or health problems they might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Stanford conducted the study by gathering phone metadata from 823 participants, collected through a custom-built Android...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates iTunes with a 'simpler' design that doesn't really help</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZp56WQkmFyQIYpG-deyiGlI_Uw=/0x0:2036x1357/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49604071/itunes124.0.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Apple knows that the iTunes interface is extremely confusing and needs work. But apparently its solution is to add even more menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple released an update to iTunes today that's supposed to give it "a simpler design," supposedly making it easier to navigate between sections to find what you're looking for. To do that, it brings back an old iTunes standby: the lefthand navigation bar, which disappeared a while back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is making nearly a million used Gamertags available</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/659enolsJQVNCq2IofM6TE7b6e0=/79x0:943x576/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49604199/CimLlVwWkAETRt3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Since the original Xbox era, players have signed onto Xbox Live with a Gamertag.  The virtual identity is akin to a Twitter username, and like Twitter usernames, many Gamertags are coveted. For example, who wants the username "Beemo1932049" when they can just have the username "Beemo"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people have stuck with the same Gamertag for years, but others have swapped old names for new ones, or abandoned Gamertags all together. This Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/732269888627195904/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;nearly a million previously used Gamertags will be "re-released."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat, of course. The Gamertags will only be available to Xbox Live Gold users who have "at least 1 year of cumulative" subscription to Microsoft's for-pay service. The Gamertags will be released across a 24-hour...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mr. Robot's season 2 trailer promises technological armageddon</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aVyNmsbPsaW2uh8lOy13FnzLhrw=/0x0:1019x679/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49603339/NUP_169819_0068_1020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Robot&lt;/i&gt; surprised everyone in its original season, and from the look of the show's new trailer, the second season is only going to get more intense. "Remember the night of the hack?" Christian Slater asks over black to kick things off, teasing the answer to a question that viewers of the show have been asking ever since last year's season finale. There are more peeks at the fallout that's occurred since — including a bit of editorial sleight of hand in which President Obama appears to comment on the show's events — and then Christian Slater leans in close to provide a not-so-subtle in-joke aimed at a particular Cupertino-based computer company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all mysterious, dark, and moody, which is exactly what you'd expect — and exactly why...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This short film made entirely with stock footage is like a trashy soap opera</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWzDCBtwd5-ZOflxgasYGkegXmM=/83x0:885x535/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49602937/Screen_Shot_2016-05-16_at_12.12.12_PM.0.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Whenever I see stock photography, I'm reminded of Ancient Greek theater. This is what happens when you put yourself in debt in order to attend a fancy art school. You justify the burden by seeing the arts in practically everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway! In Ancient Greece, actors wore big masks called prosopon. Today, the concept of concealing an actor's face seems counterintuitive, but at that time, the prosopon was  crucial to the audience's enjoyment of a play. Amphitheaters were massive, and they lacked the supplementary video screens we now associate with live events. From the cheap seats, most viewers couldn't see or hear an actor. Prosopon, which were considerably larger than an actor's head and were designed with what look like cartoonish...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube for iOS now supports Google Cardboard</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Months after &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/5/9676128/youtube-3d-video-virtual-movie-theater-google-cardboard"&gt;adding VR support&lt;/a&gt; to its Android version of YouTube, Google is bringing the feature to iPhone users. &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/youtube/id544007664?mt=8"&gt;An update to&lt;/a&gt; the iOS YouTube app notes that it now comes with Google Cardboard support, a feature that's been notably absent so far. By selecting the small Cardboard icon under any video, users can either watch a 360-degree video in virtual reality through one of the simple cardboard headsets, or watch any other video on a flat screen in a VR environment, like a big-screen TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside Samsung's Gear VR, which supports recent Samsung flagship phones, Google Cardboard is the only way most people will experience mobile virtual reality. At launch, the cheap and disposable headsets worked only with Android phones. But a second...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla will make sure 'the right thing happens’ after report of underpaid foreign workers</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2Hqc3sw1c2oVAaNK81UjEpDdJY=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49602679/akrales_160419_1019_A_0189.0.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/response-mercury-news-article-hidden-workforce-expanding-teslas-factory"&gt;public statement&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla has responded to accusations that it used cheap foreign labor to build a paint shop at one of its factories. The &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/16/11682178/tesla-imported-labor-visas"&gt;accusations&lt;/a&gt; came in a report &lt;a href="http://extras.mercurynews.com/silicon-valley-imported-labor/"&gt;from &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://extras.mercurynews.com/silicon-valley-imported-labor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mercury News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that a sub-contractor misused foreign worker visas, underpaid its employees, and then fought a worker's compensation claim saying they weren't responsible for the employee's injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Tesla largely confirms &lt;em&gt;The Mercury News&lt;/em&gt; report. Tesla says that it hired a German contractor, Eisenmann, to build a paint shop at its Fremont factory because Tesla does "not know how to built paint shops and [Eisenmann is] regarded as one of the best" in the world at building such facilities. Eisenmann hired a sub-contractor called ISM...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Talking to David Chang about Ando, his new delivery-only Momofuku startup</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_6tO9iLybfffNFnwoksvbP-TzYY=/0x85:2049x1451/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49602757/ando_ernesto.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Today, David Chang, owner of the Momofuku Group and &lt;a href="http://www.eater.com/2012/9/25/6542147/watch-david-changs-mad-talk-on-the-stigma-of-msg"&gt;patron saint of monosodium glutamate&lt;/a&gt;, is launching a &lt;a href="http://ny.eater.com/2016/3/22/11283582/david-chang-ando-delivery"&gt;new, delivery-only restaurant called Ando&lt;/a&gt;. The app is now available in iOS. But before you fire up your smartphone with visions of Milk Bar cookies, fried chicken, and ssäm sauce dancing through your head, you should know a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Ando is sending out access codes to the first 200 people who signed up on &lt;a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="http://andofood.com/"&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; to skip the line. And the delivery area is limited to just one neighborhood in Manhattan, East Midtown between East 40th Street and East 59th Street, near Ando's so-far-only physical kitchen. Delivery will be provided by Uber Rush, the ride-hail company's fast-growing courier service, but that's not Ando's...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lenovo Vibe C is your next burner</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7vI6o9TNXj8CaGYG1HIklfrbzs=/0x0:795x530/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49602437/VibeC.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;The newest edition to Lenovo's Vibe lineup of phones, the Vibe C, is the latest ultra low-cost smartphone with enough power to be a decent backup device for some users (or at least a great burner). The Lenovo Vibe C comes with a 5-inch 720p display, a quad-core processor, 4G LTE connectivity, 1GB of RAM, 5MP camera, Android 5.1.1. Lollipop, and 8GB of storage, which can be expanded to 32GB via the microSD slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aren't great specs by most standards, but for $105, the Vibe C could be a nice pickup for someone looking for a second phone. Currently the Vibe C is only being &lt;a href="http://www.ekupi.hr/Lenovo-Vibe-C-4G-LTE-pametni-telefon--Baggiz-gratisnbsp-gratis-BT-selfie-stap-893237.aspx"&gt;sold in Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, but Lenovo is likely to broaden availability in the coming weeks. The Vibe C will begin shipping on May 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Two designers of 2015's best-looking concept car have left for Hyundai</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xn8Z-HZjUW-IMBm_9Hon3guW9zU=/2x0:1016x676/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49602249/vs03-03_1659cxs-2.0.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;Hyundai &lt;a href="http://globalpr.hyundai.com/prCenter/news/newsView.do?dID=6125"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that SangYup Lee, one of the stars of the automotive design world, will be joining the company next month. Lee spent time at GM where he designed the 2006 Camaro concept that led the pony car's revival; more recently, he's led exterior design at Bentley, where he worked on last year's stunning &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/4/8143045/bentley-exp-10-speed-6-geneva-auto-show-2015"&gt;EXP 10 Speed 6&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And strangely, this isn't the first time a designer associated with the EXP 10 Speed 6 has landed at Hyundai. Last year, &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20150617/COPY01/306179981/hyundai-to-hire-ex-bentley-designer-donckerwolke-to-succeed-schreyer"&gt;the company poached Bentley design director Luc Donckerwolke&lt;/a&gt; shortly after he &lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/bentley-designer-calls-out-lincoln-continental-in-bruta-1694753569"&gt;lobbed bombs at Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the design of &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/31/8315147/lincoln-continental-concept-photos-nyias-2015"&gt;the Continental concept&lt;/a&gt; as being a little too close to Bentley's design language.&lt;/p&gt;
